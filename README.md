# <tech.blog>

## Description

- The motivation for the project was to code an application with a working schema, seeds, handlebars and working html functionality to render a tech blog page that is deployed to Heroku.

- This project was built to create an application that works as a blog with CRUD operations.

- The problem this project solves is to perform CRUD operations, where we do GET< PUT< POST< DELETE and this application should be able to do that.

- What did you learn?
I learned about the sequence of things, as far as order goes, it helped when moving through the files once it was understood. It also helped me visualize what was actually happening as working on the handlebars was not an easy task. But it helped once it clicked and it all made sense.
